## Features

#### New Post Command

You can now create new posts via the `new post` command.

Usage:

```bash
kakyll new post "My New Post.markdown"
```

- This will create a new post prefixed with the current date.
- The post name does not require quotations marks.
- Spaces in the post name are automatically converted to dashes (`-`).
- The post name must end in `.markdown` or `.md`.
- The command will fail if the post already exists.


## Bug Fixes

- Markdown Render was not previously respecting options. This resulted in features such as GitHub tables not being rendered.
